# Bloomtech Data Science - Unit 3
## 3.1: Software Engineering and Reproducible Research for Data Science

This repository serves to document and store my completed projects, assignments, and learning materials from the Bloomtech data science curriculum.

Warm-up Activities, Guided Projects (lectures) and Module Projects (assignments) for unit 3.1 are found in this repository. The projects for 3.1 are additive and build upon each previous module, and can be found in the project folder bloomdata-michael-s-luo, which contains the python package.

## The World Beyond Notebooks

Python Notebooks are great - they let us explore data and communicate and share
results. But if you want to write more general-purpose reusable code, you should
put it in a *package* - like numpy, pandas, and the other great tools we depend
on.

A full production-grade library is a large undertaking, but this week we will
build our own modest but still useful package with utility functions for common
data science tasks. Behold, **lambdata**!
